# Backpropagation 

[TOC]

### Overview 

This page is a collection of various lecture notes and web-pages which explain Back-Propagation. 

### What is Backpropagation 

Back-propagation is a commonly used method for training Neural Networks. 

### Online classes which explain Backpropagation. 

1. **CS-231N**: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
